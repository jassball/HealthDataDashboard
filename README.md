# HealthDataDashboard

The **HealthDataDashboard** is an *overengineered* project for testing just how far we can push a simple data visualization dashboard. It's designed to visualize health-related data, but let's be honest—this dashboard might just be a bit too much for its own good (and that's the point). We're here to explore all the shiny features, whether we need them or not.

## Project Status

⚠️ **Warning**: This project is currently unfinished and is no longer being worked on. Turned out to be overly complex and not fitting with the technology we chose in the end.
